1.) There appear to be 14 pins. Vdd_IO, SCL, SDA, INT2, INT1, C1, GND, Reserved, DRDY, Reserved, Reserved, SETP, SETC, Vdd. 2.5 volts to power accelerometer. The chip is right above the pins on the right side of the board.

2.) They initialize the settings so we know what device to read from, and how to do it.

3.) It gets the raw data from the buffer and converts it to a floating-point value so the accelerometer code can interpret it.

4.) The z-value of the chip can completely throw off the compass value, which, for the sake of simplicity, is only concerned with x and y values.

There was still the issue of pixel corruption from previous values being on the lcd screen. So by the suggestion of an AI I wrote 2 helper functions to draw a "dot" (3x3 pixels) and erase a dot. This got rid of the issue. So I guess there's something wrong with my "draw area" function, but I can't figure out what it would be.
