Things I learned:
-getchar() returns an int instead of a char, and why (EOF)
-how to use the gdb debugger (breakpoints, memory dumping)

-I was rusty on Unix, so it was a bit of a challenge getting back on par with the terminal and the environment. It was also tricky writing my own Makefile for the poly/dump program, but now I feel more comfortable about it.
