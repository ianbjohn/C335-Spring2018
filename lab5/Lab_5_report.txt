-What does CS pin do? 
	-Enables the correct device for communication. It is used to signal to the slave when a transfer of data is starting and ending.

-WHy do you set the CS pin high at the end of the pin initilializations?
	-It is part of the standard protocol to signal that a transaction needs to occur (Setting the pin to low) and signalling that a transaction has successfully occured (Setting the pin to high). Read, write both do this.

-How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?
	-By using the CS pin to ensure that the data is directed at the correct slave device.

-STM has Operating Frequency of 72MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you need to set the baud rate prescaler to?
	-8
-What is the resulting frequency?


-Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the mictocontroller (master?)
	-Yes
-Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?


Difficulties:
	-Getting the LEDs to display properly, Getting UART to correctly transmit the data (Spend an entire office hours session getting this to work.)
