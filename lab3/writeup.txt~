1.) Specs:
	-8Kb RAM, 128Kb flash RAM
2.) GPIO - General Purpose Input/Output

4.) The green LEDs are at port E and have pins 11 and 15
5.) GPIO_Mode, GPIO_OType, GPIO_Pin, GPIO_PuPd, GPIO_Speed

Difficulties:
-Getting an integer input to correctly map to a sequence of LEDs was challenging, and we eventually just settled on a switch/case block to make things easier.
-Getting everything set up initially was also a hurdle. It took me a while to realize I'd forgotten to add function definitions in the two driver header files.
