1.) The peripheral base address points to the SPI data register. We need to knwo where to start writing / reading data from.

5.) They both can't access the same part of memory at once

Updating the LCD/SD driver was difficult, there were lots of little bits that made it confusing and difficult for me, and it was further complicated by weird compiler errors.

Converting audio I found difficult, since my audio_init function somehow wound up being blank, and I couldn't find any information in the lab manual about what to do for this. It also wasn't in the original driver file. Converting my WAV files to the correct sample rate / bit rate was really frustrating, and I can't help but feel that I made it way more difficult than it was supposed to be. I converted everything to 16 bit, which still sounded corrupted.

I learned more about DMA and how it actually works in a "code" sense.
It also took a while for the audio to finally get played, as I had to make sure a bunch of different header files were correct.
