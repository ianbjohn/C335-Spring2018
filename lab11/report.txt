1.) The peripheral base address points to the SPI data register. We need to knwo where to start writing / reading data from.

2.) The DMA controller will automatically increment the address it's pointing to after reading from / writing to it.

3.) Once a request for transferring / receiving has been made, the DMA controller needs to wait for it to get accepted. So it polls the DMA status until it gets reset.

4.)

5.) They both can't access the same part of memory at once

Updating the LCD/SD driver was difficult, there were lots of little bits that made it confusing and difficult for me, and it was further complicated by weird compiler errors.

Converting audio was difficult, but I finally figured out how to do it with Audacity. I don't know if the program was supposed to be able to handle different bitrates, but the sounds were able to be played after conversion

I learned more about DMA and how it actually works in a "code" sense.
It also took a while for the audio to finally get played, as I had to make sure a bunch of different header files were correct.
