I think the biggest challenge was integrating all the stuff from the previous 2 labs into one program, and having it all work correctly while still having the code be maintainable and clean.

The most interesting part to me was learning how a nunchuk actually works.

1.)

2.) It gets the last 2 bits of the byte 5, to see if the C and Z buttons were pressed or not. From there, it sets the nunchuk structure's data accordingly to say which button's were pressed.

3.) The variables correspond to the position of the joystick (x and y), the magnitude of the accelerometer (x, y and z), and the states of the C and Z buttons (whether or not they're pressed.)

4.) The 2 least significant bits of data[5] correspond to the button states of the nunchuck. There are 4 combinations total, and for each one, the respective variables in the nunchuk structure are set accordingly.
